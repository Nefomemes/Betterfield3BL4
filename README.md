## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between an unminified file and the minified one?

A minified file is much smaller in size than an unminified file. However, it's not human-readable and not good for development. If you wish to read the code and stuff like that, use the unminified file. If not, use the minified file. Minified files are marked with `.min` before it's file extension.
